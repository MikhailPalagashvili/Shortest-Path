# Shortest-Path
SP find the shortest path on a directed graph that uses weighted-edges. The underlying difference between MST and finding the SP is that MST works only on an undirected graph and SP works only on a directed graph. SP finds the shortest path from a given source vertex to every other vertex using two array like data structures. The problem is solved using relaxation; to relax an edge v->w means to test whether the best known way from s to w is to go from s straight to w or from s to v, then take the edge from v to w; if the shortest path changes we must relax the edge where all that means is update our two array like data structures which highlight our new shortest path from source vertex (s) to w. Complications arise when the edges are negative and when there are cycles involved. Dijkstra's algorithm solves the problem where there are no negative egdes and topological sort can solves the problem with negative edges but no cycles. If you want an algorithm that solves the problem of both cycles and negative weighted-edges than it is best to look into the Bellman Ford algorithm. Dijkstra solves the problem using space proportional to V and time proportional to E log V; topological sort solves the problem using time complexity proportional to E + V.
